  <h1>Say to my friends when they see me dead (قل لإخوان رأوني ميتا)</h1>
  <aside></aside>
  <p><blockquote>
<p>Imam Al Ghazzali woke up one early morning and as usual offered his prayers. He then enquired what day it was and his younger brother, Ahmad Ghazzali replied, &ldquo;Monday&rdquo;.
He asked him to bring his white shroud, kissed it, stretched himself full length and saying “Lord, I obey willingly,” breathed his last.</p>

<p>Underneath his head rest they found the following verses; composed by him, probably, during the night:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Say to my friends, when they look upon me, dead,</p>

<p>Weeping for me and mourning me in sorrow,</p>

<p>‘Do not believe that this corpse you see is myself,</p>

<p>In the name of God, I tell you, it is not I,</p>

<p>I am a spirit, and this is naught but flesh,</p>

<p>It was my abode and my garment for a time.</p>

<p>I am a treasure, by a talisman kept hid,</p>

<p>Fashioned of dust, which served me as a shrine,</p>

<p>I am a pearl, which has left it’s shell deserted,</p>

<p>I am a bird, and this body was my cage,</p>

<p>Whence I have now flown forth and it is left as a token,</p>

<p>Praise to God, who hath now set me free,</p>

<p>And prepared for me my place in the highest of the Heavens,</p>

<p>Until today I was dead, though alive in your midst.</p>

<p>Now I live in truth, with the grave – clothes discarded.</p>

<p>Today I hold converse with the Saints above,</p>

<p>With no veil between, I see God face to face.</p>

<p>I look upon “Loh-i-Mahfuz” and there in I read,</p>

<p>Whatever was and is, and all that is to be.</p>

<p>Let my house fall in ruins, lay my cage in the ground,</p>

<p>Cast away the talisman, it is a token no more,</p>

<p>Lay aside my cloak, it was but my outer garment.</p>

<p>Place them all in the grave, let them be forgotten,</p>

<p>I have passed on my way and you are left behind,</p>

<p>Your place of abode was no dwelling place for me.</p>

<p>Think not that death is death, nay, it is life,</p>

<p>A life that surpasses all we could dream of here,</p>

<p>While in this world, here we are granted sleep,</p>

<p>Death is but sleep, sleep that shall be prolonged</p>

<p>Be not frightened when death draweth nigh,</p>

<p>It is but the departure for this blessed home,</p>

<p>Think of the mercy and love of your Lord,</p>

<p>Give thanks for His Grace and come without fear.</p>

<p>What I am now, even so shall you be,</p>

<p>For I know that you are even as I am,</p>

<p>The souls of all men come forth from God,</p>

<p>The bodies of all are compounded alike,</p>

<p>Good and evil, alike it was ours.</p>

<p>I give you now a message of good cheer</p>

<p>May God’s peace and joy forever more be yours.</p>
